# Crowdfunding ETL

This ETL mini project, was completed with a partner (Chris Johnson) to practice building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD (as seen below) and a table schema, concluding by uploading the CSV files into the newly created database tables.

# Files included:
* ETL_Mini_Project_KMcMurphy.ipynb - the Jupyter Notwbook containing the extraction and transform steps, along with data export
* crowdfunding_schema.sql - the SQL schema used to build and query the tables
* Resources - the initial XLSX data files and CSV outputs
